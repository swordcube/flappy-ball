# 🏀 Flappy Ball
A horribly made flappy bird clone using Godot 4

## ⚠️ There's different pipe colors, here's what they all do:
- 🟢 Green - Your standard pipe, don't touch it or you lose
- 🔴 Red - Same as green but it moves up and down in a wave constantly
- 🟠 Orange - Same as the previous but you gain a speed boost if you successfully gain score
- 🔵 Blue - Same as red but moves down faster than up (can also move up faster than down idk i haven't really tested)

Also you're a basket ball because i don't know how to draw a good bird in pixel art
